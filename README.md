# Youtube Via Facebook Messenger  

For the lazy folks (of _IIT Roorkee_ and elsewhere) who listen to music on YouTube, now you don't have to go anywhere from Facebook or get up from the bed if you're using FB Messenger on your phone, to change a song on YouTube.  

A tool to control YouTube using Facebook messenger. Run the script and once set up, just fire up Facebook chat or messenger on any of your devices and start chatting with yourself to control YouTube.
